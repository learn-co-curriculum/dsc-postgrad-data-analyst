# Data Analyst

## Introduction

Data Analysts use descriptive statistics or basic models to generate insights about data. They source, query, and prepare their own data and use descriptive statistics or basic algorithms to analyze it. Sometimes this analysis is primarily diagnostic (understanding what is happening or has already happened) and sometimes it is primarily predictive. Data Analysts then produce reports, visualizations, and/or dashboards to communicate findings to multiple stakeholders.
